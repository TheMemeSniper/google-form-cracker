AIM-9 Sidewinder for google forms

# What does it do?
This program seeks for ```quot``` in a Google Form's source code. When found, it will be written to output.txt

This program can break the following forms:
- Escape Rooms
- Poorly Designed Tests
- Anything else that uses the response validation feature

# How do I read this?

This program outputs the full line it finds ```quot``` on, since ```quot``` is used by Google Forms to indicate most response validation options, this will also dump the answer to that question.
